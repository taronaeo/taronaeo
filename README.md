### Hallo, ich bin Aaron Teo! 👋🏻

---

I'm a Security Solutions Engineer working on IBM Z & LinuxONE at IBM Technology (Singapore), and a Technology Engineer at IBM Singapore. Currently, I am working on implementing SIMD activations on Llama.cpp to exploit Vector Extensions on z15 and later mainframes.

If you are interested in my work, follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@taronaeo) where I document my findings, research and progress in the world of AI on Z.

Outside of work, I'm a cybersecurity student studying at Nanyang Polytechnic. In my free time, I help to build, and maintain systems running at [@RIVAlumni](https://github.com/RIVAlumni).

Reach out to me at aaron.teo1@ibm.com (IBM-related matters), or taronaeo@gmail.com.
