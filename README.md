### Hallo, ich bin Aaron Teo! 👋🏻

I'm a Security Solutions Engineer for IBM Technology (Singapore) working on IBM Z & LinuxONE mainframes, and a Technology Engineer for IBM Singapore.

Outside of work, I'm a cybersecurity student studying at Nanyang Polytechnic. In my free time, I help to build, and maintain systems running at [@RIVAlumni](https://github.com/RIVAlumni).
